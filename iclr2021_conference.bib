abstract = {Dubai is an emerging metropolis with unique features, such as an extremely high expatriate ratio and turnover rate. These features, along with the extreme climatic conditions and dependency on energy-intensive water desalination, cause the electricity load to be high per capita and highly variable. Therefore, producing accurate electricity consumption predictions is critical to prevent blackouts or power loss, particularly for fast-growing cities. This study predicts the monthly electricity consumption in Dubai using various linear regression variants, support vector machines, decision tree models, ensemble models, and neural networks. The dataset consists of different demographic and climatic features as well as more than 50 million electricity consumption observations aggregated in monthly community-wide records. By analyzing the correlation between the various features and electricity consumption, a set of 18 factors was determined, with the number of expat sites, the total number of sites, and population identified as the most influential variables. The models examined were trained on the selected features, and their prediction performance was evaluated using various evaluation metrics. The results showed that the ensemble models were best in predicting consumption. Random forest outperformed the rest when trained using a temporally ordered dataset with 0.0437 and 0.0226 as root mean square error and mean absolute error values, respectively. In addition, the employment of a randomly split dataset resulted in better performance. Ensemble models were found to predict electricity consumption accurately when trained on 60% of the historical consumption records. The generalization and reliability of the top models were further tested by varying the training data volumes and applying rolling and moving cross-validation. Training the models on a fixed-size moving window of historical records leads to better performance and more reliable prediction.}

abstract = {Faced with the explosive growth of population and rapid development of industrialization, household electricity demand (HED) has recently become an essential sector of energy demand. Very-short-term forecasting of HED is closely related to monitoring insecurity, detecting emergency and potential crisis. Consider challenges triggered by the characteristics of time series, firstly, a phase of data pre-processing with stationarity of time series is constructed to manage irregular trend factors. Subsequently, in the feature selection phase, a two-layer feature selection method is proposed with the combination of random forest and autocorrelation analysis to select the most relevant features, which simultaneously considers correlations and importance of input lagged variables as well as exogenous variables. After that, hybrid HED forecasting methods are constructed with incorporating multiple machine learning techniques in the forecasting phase, namely k-nearest neighbor, support vector regression, random forest and multilayer perceptron, using their respective advantages of managing different situations. As residents’ psychological preferences and calendar variables highly affect future HED, this paper intends to add and test their effects on HED. Finally, the proposed methods are examined on a 10-min-ahead horizon application, whose forecasting results, comparison analyses and an extended experiment are given to illustrate their effectiveness, after which some implications are provided to show the insights gained from the results.}

abstract = {In short-term load forecast (STLF), forecasting holiday load is one of the most challenging problems. Aimed at this problem, a hybrid prediction model based on pattern sequence-based matching method and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) is presented. It divides holiday STLF problem into the predictions for proportional curve and daily extremum of electricity demand, which are relatively independent and relate to different factors. It is benefit for holiday STLF by task decomposing. Based on the shape similarity measured by Euclidean distance, the proportional curve is predicted by pattern sequence-based matching method. Daily extremum of electricity demand is predicted by XGBoost considering holiday classification. Finally, the predicted holiday load profile is synthesized from the above two prediction results with segment correction. The proposed methodology can analyze holiday load characteristics more effectively and get a higher prediction accuracy independent of sufficient data and expert experience. We evaluate our methodology with many algorithms on a real data set of one provincial capital city in eastern China. The results of case studies show that the proposed methodology gives much better forecasting accuracy with an average error 2.98% in holidays.}

abstract = {This paper proposes an appropriate model to forecast the trend of white sugar consumption rate in Thailand due to the fluctuation of consumption rate nowadays. This paper will focus on two main forecasting model types, which are the regression models and neural network models. Moreover, the performance is evaluated by using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Theil’U statistic value. After processing the experiments, the results demonstrate that Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network provides the best performance for the forecasting, with the condition of combination between the existing consumption rate and other relevant factors like production supply, import rate, export rate, and inventory stock. Also tuning the model’s parameters is an important issue.}
